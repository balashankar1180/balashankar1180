### Hello World <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I'm Balashankar Gujja. A passionate self-taught Front-end web developer from India. My passion for Web Designing lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I'm also an Open-Source Enthusiast and Maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community where people feel that they are learning things, that they're contributing things, that they're being valued. I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
